    "## 1. Setting Up Tools ‚öôÔ∏è\n",
    "In the beginning of the course, we focused on preparing our environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- We created a **GitHub account** so we could manage and store code online.  \n",
    "- We installed **Homebrew**, which is a package manager that makes it easy to install and update tools on macOS.  \n",
    "- We set up a **Python virtual environment (venv)** to keep our projects organized and avoid conflicts between libraries.  \n",
    "- We installed and learned how to use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as our main code editor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup step was important because it gave us the foundation to code, save our work, and collaborate.  \n"

    "\n",
    "- We pulled (`git pull`) the **student repository**, which is where we keep our personal work.  \n",
    "- We also pulled the **pages repository**, which is used to publish and display web content.  \n",
    "- We practiced basic **Git commands** like `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.  \n",

    "  - üåç *As a Conversation Starter* (places we have lived)  \n",

    "- The content wasn‚Äôt just plain text ‚Äî it was organized into categories, with images (like flags) and labels.  \n",
    "- At the bottom, we even had a **comment box** powered by GitHub, which showed how our About page could be interactive.  \n",

    "- By experimenting with jokes, we got a fun introduction to how code interacts with a webpage.  \n",

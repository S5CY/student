    "# Creating Our Game: The M&M Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "We wanted to create something fun, educational, and interactive. Instead of just making a simple tutorial, we designed a **game** to help people learn coding skills and concepts like running commands (`source venv/bin/activate`) in a playful way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We used **M&M characters** as a metaphor for learning:  \n",
    "- A blank, colorless M&M represented the beginner.  \n",
    "- As the player progressed, the M&M gained colors, showing knowledge gained.  \n",
    "- By the end, the M&M was **rainbow-colored**, symbolizing mastery.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Design & Levels\n",
    "We designed two levels, each with unique challenges and M&M characters:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level 1**  \n",
    "  - Red M&M  \n",
    "  - Orange M&M  \n",
    "  - Focus: Introductory coding concepts and first steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level 2**  \n",
    "  - Green M&M  \n",
    "  - Blue M&M  \n",
    "  - Purple M&M  \n",
    "  - Focus: More advanced concepts that built on the foundation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of both levels, players faced a **quiz**, testing their understanding before the M&M could transform into its final rainbow form.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation Process\n",
    "The project required both **coding and design skills**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backgrounds**: We created custom backgrounds to set the mood of each level.  \n",
    "- **Gameplay**: The player moved the blank M&M through challenges to “collect” knowledge.  \n",
    "- **Learning Integration**: Each color unlocked new coding commands or concepts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge was making sure the **educational content and the game mechanics worked together**. We didn’t just want it to be fun — we wanted people to actually **learn while playing**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Achievements\n",
    "This project helped us grow in several ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creativity**: Turning coding tutorials into a colorful game was a unique challenge.  \n",
    "- **Collaboration**: We worked as a team, dividing up tasks like backgrounds, mechanics, and quiz design.  \n",
    "- **Problem Solving**: We debugged both code errors and design issues to make sure everything flowed smoothly.  \n",
    "- **Teaching**: By explaining coding concepts through gameplay, we learned to simplify complex ideas for beginners.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "Working on this project taught me more than just coding:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coding Skills**: Reinforced my understanding of running environments and commands.  \n",
    "- **Design Thinking**: How to make learning fun and engaging through visuals and interactivity.  \n",
    "- **Communication**: Breaking down technical steps into simple lessons for players.  \n",
    "- **Persistence**: When something didn’t work, I kept testing and improving until it did.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project showed me that **teaching doesn’t have to be boring**. By combining coding with creativity, we built something fun, memorable, and effective. Watching a blank M&M transform into a rainbow symbolized not just the player’s journey — but also my own growth as a coder, designer, and problem-solver.  "
